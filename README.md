# Readme first


I just fix some compile issues for this PowerIK plugins when migrating my project. Upload this fix is for saving time for anyone meet the same problem.

Thanks for PowerIK provide us the cheapest solution for foot IK. 

The repository https://github.com/tornellihenrique/PowerIK-UE5.2 was used as a basis.
I adapted it for Unreal Engine 5.5 and added Android support for builds for VR project on Meta Quest

Problems setting bones for bending at the knees were fixed.

Note: Unreal engine 5 provide more elegant ControlRig for this (and need a little bit blueprint programing unfortunately).


## How to use
If you have same issue. 
Just copy this repo to your [project name]/Plugins/PowerIK

And this is only tested on the Node in AnimGraph. The control rig PowerIK node is not tested.


This project is OWNED by the original auther. (not me)
